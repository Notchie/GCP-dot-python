# GCP Dot interface
This is some simple python code that accesses the GCP dot on https://global-mind.org/gcpdot/, caches the results and prints them to console, feel free to adapt the code for your own uses if you give credit, or to try improve the code yourself (i'm not the best at coding)

### Not implemented:
 - setting a color value
### Future plans:
- use as a module for other scripts
- clean up the code
